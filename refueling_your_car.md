# Refueling your car 

Self-service bays at the gas station allow you to refill your car's gas tank by yourself. This is more economical than paying for a service attendant to fill your tank at a full-service bay.
 
1. Enter the self-service bay on the same side as your car's gas cap cover and park the car as close to the fuel pump as possible.
 
2. Shut off the car engine.
 
3. Extinguish all cigarettes.
 
4. Unlock and remove the gas cap from the tank.

5. Remove the nozzle of the gas hose from its cradle and insert it into the car's gas tank. 

   **Caution:** Ensure that the nozzle is inserted securely into the tank. Otherwise, the pump may fail to turn off automatically once the gas tank is full.
 
6. Swipe your credit card for payment at the pump and enter the required verification details, or pay cash in advance at the station's service counter.

7. Wait until the pump registers a series of zeroes, indicating that you can begin filling the tank. 

8. Squeeze the handle of the nozzle until the gas starts to flow and numbers start registering on the pump. 

9. Raise the tab located on the underside of the nozzle handle and secure it into place so that the handle remains "squeezed" and gas continues to flow into the gas tank automatically. 

   This frees you to perform other tasks, such as washing your car's windows, while the tank is being filled. 

10. When the tank is full and the flow of gas has shut off automatically, gently remove the nozzle from the gas tank and return it to its cradle. 

    **Note:** To manually stop the flow of gas at any time, release the tab that keeps the nozzle open.

11. Shut and lock the gas cap. 

12. To print a receipt, on the pump's credit card keypad, press **Enter**. 

 The receipt appears in the slot next to the keypad.
